(allen and patrick (1996) examined long-run ipo performance).when long run is defined as twelve years instead of the usual five years, seos can be clearly seen to turn around their performance particularly during years six and seven. a series of regression results point to a number of factors that bear influence on the extent of the initial underperformance. decreased ex-ante uncertainty associated with older firms causes a negative relationship between the age and the extent of underpricing. moreover, the greater is the seo cost specifically associated with underpricing of the new equity, the greater will be the underperformance that follows the issue.

{WS_FSLASH}modsim05{WS_FSLASH}papers{WS_FSLASH}athanasiadis.pdf	 environmental software, agents and multi-agent systems, agent-oriented software engineering, environmental management, decision support and simulation  extended abstract during the last few years, agents and agent-based systems have attracted a significant amount of at-tention from researchers in environmental infor-matics. agent-based approaches have been adopted for developing environmental systems for data management, decision support or simulation purposes. in order to identify the degree of pene-tration of agent technology in environmental soft-ware systems, over twenty applications reported in the recent literature have been reviewed from a software engineering perspective. these applica-tions use agent-based approaches and methods, either as metaphor for software design or as an abstraction for software develop-ment.  as a software design metaphor, agents are consid-ered as the building blocks of a system. agent related technologies for software design include techniques for system require-ments specification, software modelling, specification and verification. taking a step ahead, agent technology has moved to agent-oriented software engineering that adopts agents in the whole software de-sign process, as for example in gaia. on the second front (that of software implementa-tion) there is a plethora of agent deployment strategies that might vary from object oriented programming and custom multi-agent systems to agent platforms. the latter have emerged as the evolution of object-oriented programming and distributed computing, and utilize agents as the basic software unit for developing systems. this paper attempts to summarize recent develop-ments in environmental informatics that exploit agent technology. all the applications presented in this paper have been evaluated from a software point of view, i.e. the adoption of agent technolo-gies for software design or/and implementation is in the focus. the result of this survey provides an outlook of agent use in environmental software, illustrated graphically in fig-ure 1. the main conclusion of this presentation is that agent technology has been only par-tially adopted in environmental in-formatics. there is still space for exploiting agent technology in envi-ronmental software, by adopting agent-oriented software engineering and agent programming techniques in future developments. 
{WS_FSLASH}modsim05{WS_FSLASH}papers{WS_FSLASH}backeus.pdf	 climate change; forest management planning under uncertainty; reinforcement learningextended abstract forest management is classically modeled as a deterministic planning problem where decisions are determined in advance unconditionally to future events. this approach has led to the development of efficient optimization methods based on linear programming which can solve large forest management problems as encountered in scandinavian countries. recent research results have nevertheless established that it could be essential from an economical point of view to consider stochastic phenomena in the definition of long term forest management problems such as natural hazards and market uncertainties. climate change will have important effects on forest ecosystems in the long run. it is a new fundamental reason to go beyond deterministic planning approaches in forest management. according to the last scenarios published by ipcc, the average temperature increase in the world might be in the range of 1.4 to 5.8° by year 2100. at regional level, a model developed by sweclim for sweden predicts an increase between 2.5°c to 4.5°c by 2100, but there is also a considerable uncertainty regarding the future climate trajectory. in the study presented in this paper, we investigated the impact of such climate change uncertainty on the solutions of forest management problems for typical swedish stands with several species. our main objective was to determine whether taking into account uncertainty can improve the best deterministic solutions obtained by considering average temperature change scenarios. such stochastic planning problems are theoretically solved by dynamic programming or related methods. however, these approaches can rarely be employed when complex growth and yield models are used. the second methodological objective of this study was thus to assess the effectiveness of new alternative stochastic simulation methods like simulation-based optimization or reinforcement learning for solving forest management planning problems with stochastic features. in the work described in this paper, we analyzed approximate optimal policies obtained for forest management problems under climate variability and change. these problems were defined on the basis of a forest management model called gaya and a climate change model developed for the purpose of this study. approximate optimal policies were obtained with linear-q-learning(l), a reinforcement learning algorithm. they were compared with approximate optimal plans obtained by considering average climate change scenarios. we studied fictive stands with one, two and three species. the stands were located in southern and northern sweden and contained the species pine, spruce and birch. the stands were simulated for 20 five-year long periods years. reinforcement learning converged toward approximate optimal policies after few simulations, even for complex stands with several species, either for problems with deterministic or stochastic scenarios. ours results showed that there was a gain in considering stochastic models, but also that the magnitude of this gain was small. considering climate change uncertainty improved the value of approximate optimal programs, but deterministic plans was sometime still optimal. this important conclusion can be explained by the relatively small estimated value of the growth effect, that lead to a quasi-deterministic dynamics of the stand state, and by the symmetry of the temperature change distribution around the average scenario. our analysis lies entirely on the stochastic climate change model we developed, based on the sweclim regional climate modeling for northern europe. its main limitation is its stationary assumption on probabilities of the future climate change scenarios. modeling today the probable fall of uncertainty in the future may be a complicated task. note however that such a decreasing uncertainty model should strengthen our present conclusions.

{WS_FSLASH}modsim05{WS_FSLASH}papers{WS_FSLASH}balston.pdf	 climate variability; fisheries modelling; lates calcarifer; management. extended abstract barramundi (lates calcarifer) is an important queensland commercial fishery that exhibits dramatic inter-annual fluctuations in catch which, according to fishers, are explained in part by variations in the climate. traditionally, modelling of fisheries harvest has focussed on the development of surplus production/yield models which use catch and effort data, and more complex age-structured models. more recently, however, the effect of climate variability has been shown to have a significant impact on the catch of fisheries such as anchovies, and so techniques to incorporate climate parameters into fisheries modelling and management are being developed. this paper explores, through correlation and cross validated regression modelling techniques, the possible impact of climate variability on the commercial barramundi fishery harvest in princess charlotte bay (pcb) far north queensland which varies on a year-to-year basis. results suggest a strong relationship between tested climate variables two years prior and annual barramundi landings. a conceptual model explaining the life history of the barramundi was constructed to reduce the number of variables used in the analysis. selected climate variables (air temperature, sea surface temperature (sst), evaporation, fresh water flows), and climate forecasting indices (southern oscillation index (soi) and madden julian oscillation (mjo)), were initially correlated against local commercial catch data for pcb. forward stepwise ridge regression (fsrr) analysis was then used in constructing models to quantify the effects of climate on barramundi. zero-lagged correlations support the well established theory that early wet season fresh water flow affects the catchability of barramundi in pcb. this is because fish in the fresh water reaches are flushed into the estuary (and fishing grounds) in these years. next, a fsrr model was developed from climate variables and selected: rainfall july - september-2 (lagged two years), annual evaporation-2 and october œ december soi (no lag) and explained 67.6% of the variance in catch adjusted for effort. a second model using climate forecasting indices explained only 53.1% of the variance in catch adjusted for effort. however, because each of these models required data collected in the year of fishing, they did not allow sufficient time for a response from fisheries managers or operators. a third fsrr model using climate variables known to impact on spawning and early juvenile development 2-3 years earlier, included rain july œ september-2, evaporation annual-2 and average january œ march sst-2 and explained 62.7% of the variance in catch. when the predictive capacity of the model was tested using a cross validated ﬁleave-one-outﬂ regression analysis, 48.1% of the variance in future catch was explained (figure 1). -25000.0-20000.0-15000.0-10000.0-5000.00.05000.010000.015000.020000.025000.01989/901990/911991/921992/931993/941994/051995/961996/971997/981998/991999/002000/012001/02yearcatch adjusted for effortobservedvaluepredictedvaluefigure 1: predicted vs observed values from the lagged model.  475
{WS_FSLASH}modsim05{WS_FSLASH}papers{WS_FSLASH}boschetti.pdf	 collective intelligence; complex adaptive systems; minority game; resource management.extended abstract it is largely understood that the contribution which scientific research can provide to the management of limited renewable resources includes not only the study of the dynamics of the resource itself, but also the understanding of how humans interact with the resource and ultimately manage its exploitation. for long the realm of qualitative social science, the last decade or so has seen the pioneering of quantitative study of certain aspects of human behaviour and, despite still at its infancy, interesting applications start to appear (little et al, 2004, dreyfus-leon 1999, varis 1998). one instance of such effort, applied to the competition for limited resources, has been pioneered by arthur (1994) and later generalized in what is now called minority game (mg, see challet and zhang 1998). this tool has allowed scientists to highlight unexpected behaviours displayed by the community as a whole. the fundamental reason for the complexity of the mg (and of the competition for limited renewable resource in general) is its self-referential and self-defeating nature (batten, 2005). imagine a group of individuals who routinely has to choose where to access a limited resource. the amount of the resource an individual can obtain depends on how many other individuals choose to access the resource at the same location (since the resource is limited and needs to be shared). how many individuals choose a specific location depends in turn by the expectation that the location will be more or less exploited. such expectation will guide the individuals™ choice and consequently its final level of exploitation. consequently, the expectation actually determines the outcome: this is the self-referential aspect. also, the more individuals expect a location to be profitable, the more will access it and the less profitable the location will result. the expectation actually determines the opposite outcome: this is the self-defeating aspect. the self-referential and self-defeating nature of the mg has lead some authors to suggest that optimal exploitation of a limited resource is not possible under purely competitive pressure (hardin, 1968). the purpose of this work is to show that, at least under specific circumstances, this may not be necessarily so. the tool we employ is called collective intelligence (coin, wolpert and tumer 1999). it has been proposed to address a number of engineering problems (mostly in computer science, see tumer and wolpert 2000, wolpert et al, 2004) and has already shown good result on a generalized from of the mg (wolpert et al 2000, wolpert and tumer 2001). our contribution is to simplify this method with the view of a possible use by actual human communities. we show that a coin could potentially be employed by real people with no need of computer aid, by simply performing elementary calculation with pen and paper. we test its potential on a fishery exploitation problem and compare the results to different algorithms traditionally used in the mg literature, in which individuals act either randomly or rationally and can evolve their behaviour. the important result is that the use of coin leads to improved resource exploitation not only for the overall community but also for each individual (on average), that is, no personal sacrifice is required for the good of the community. this may be a crucial factor in opening the road to a possible use of coin in real applications. the results could naturally be extended to the exploitation of resources other than fisheries. 1. competition for limited resources: problem setting in this section we describe our test problem. we model a fishing fleet composed of competitive vessels, targeting a limited resource of a single fish species. in our virtual fishery we employ n fishing vessels nn..1=(agents in the general cas literature). at each iteration of the game, each individual vessel needs to choose where to fish among z available zones (only one zone can be chosen by a vessel at each iteration). in each zone a certain amount of

{WS_FSLASH}modsim05{WS_FSLASH}papers{WS_FSLASH}cordier.pdf	 stream water quality, modeling, simulation, machine learning.extended abstract streamwater pollution by pesticides is a critical environmental issue in farmed catchment areas. many important factors are involved in this pollution phenomenon, like weather, area topology, land use and crop management practices, which all influence streamwater quality. the purpose of the ongoing study presented in this paper is to evaluate the impact of land use and management practices on streamwater pollution. we use modelling, simulation and machine learning techniques for acquiring knowledge about this complex domain. our main objective is to learn qualitative rules relating the pollution factors to the temporal distribution of the stream pesticide concentration. the study area is the farmed catchment of fremeur (~17 km2), located in brittany, france. our approach relies on a simulation model, called sacadeau, which is based on two main components: a biophysical transfer model and a decision model. the biophysical transfer model simulates pesticide transfer through the catchment, from application sites on maize parcels, to the river. the decision model simulates farm management practices such as tillage, sowing, and pesticide application. the two other components of the sacadeau model include a climate model which provides daily rainfall and temperature, and a spatial model which describes land use and catchment topology (figure 1). this simulation model is used for generating a large number of scenarios of the catchment system, considering different weather series or spatial distributions of land use and agricultural activities.  figure 1: the sacadeau model machine learning techniques were used to interpret the very complex and large set of results. icl, an inductive logic programming software, generated a set of simple rules which described the factors influencing streamwater contamination. this demonstrated that soil characteristics, and in particular organic carbon content, are a key factor controlling contamination. other important factors are: type of pesticide used, timing and quantity of rainfall, and topology of the catchment. the sacadeau model is not yet fully implemented and the first results have been obtained with a simplified model. we were able to check the coherence and the feasibility of our approach, and to build a first view of the role of some attributes in stream-water quality. when the sacadeau model is fully operational, it should be possible to develop more specific rules that incorporate a greater level of details about spatial and temporal variations.

{WS_FSLASH}modsim05{WS_FSLASH}papers{WS_FSLASH}daniell.pdf	 sustainability assessment; multi-agent modelling; urban systems.extended abstract challenges facing urban planners and governments continue to mount as populations in urban areas increase, pressure on the world's resources reaches critical levels and degradation of ecosystems around the world becomes increasingly apparent. the movement towards sustainable development has been met with enthusiasm by decision-makers, although exactly how to achieve this target, or even measure progress towards it, is not entirely evident. this paper explores how complex urban systems can be modelled holistically using a multi-agent based framework, and their sustainability assessed using a systems approach. there are numerous subsystems and corresponding resources (natural, financial, human and man-made) within an urban development such as water, energy, transport, waste, economic and social systems. all of these subsystems and their interrelations can be modelled using multi-agent systems, along with effects of human behaviour, both spatially and temporally, in order to provide planners, developers and decision-makers with a better platform for understanding the complexities of the urban form. as well as the presentation of a general overview of how the complexities of urban systems can be best captured using integrated modelling techniques such as multi-agent systems, the austime methodology, ﬁassessment of urban sustainability through integrated modelling and explorationﬂ, will be briefly presented. this methodology is designed to show how quantifiable sustainability assessment, based on system resource thresholds, and multi-agent based modelling, can be integrated into a framework that can be used for decision making and management relating to policy, regulation, planning, design and development of urban systems. the framework is designed to form part of a cyclic process, such as an adaptive management and learning or total quality management cycle that can explicitly include stakeholder participation and ongoing evaluation.  specific examples of the implementation of this methodology are provided from a case study of christie walk, an eco-development in inner-city adelaide, australia. the case study involves the development of a prototype multi-agent based model coupled with a sustainability assessment framework that allows quantifiable sustainability comparisons for a range of indicators between the christie walk development and the larger adelaide metropolitan area. simulation results show that the eco-development performs significantly better than the majority of adelaide metropolitan developments, specifically in carbon dioxide production, where the development™s occupants rate below the 5th percentile of all adelaide residents. the model is subsequently used to examine scenarios relating to changes in occupant behaviour, development infrastructure and location. simulations comparing the relative impacts of car ownership and use behaviour, and infrastructure design changes (where air conditioners and heaters are required to regulate indoor temperatures), show that high in-house electricity use behaviour related to infrastructure changes to christie walk could have a greater effect on equivalent carbon dioxide production than increased car ownership and use (potentially due to a location change to an outer suburb of the adelaide metropolitan area). this result is just one example that highlights the necessity for planners and governments to consider the relative importance and effects of all subsystems in urban areas on the overall system's sustainability before attempting to design and choose management options and plans. it is envisaged that the austime methodology and case study application will help provide an example of how integrated modelling and sustainability assessment can be built into adaptive management cycles and effectively used as a decision making tool to work towards the sustainable development of urban environments and their inhabitants.;; ;; ;;;;

{WS_FSLASH}modsim05{WS_FSLASH}papers{WS_FSLASH}dekker.pdf	 agent-based simulation; network topology; scale-free network; small-world network.extended abstract in this paper, we describe a new agent-based simulation system for studying the impact of network topology on military combat performance. since the timescales of message transfer and agent movement can differ significantly, the simulation is event-based rather than time-step. figure (i) shows a snapshot of the simulation in operation. figure (i). snapshot of combat simulation the networks we explore in this paper are generated using the process introduced by kawachi et al (2004), which alters the topology of a network without altering the number of links. by varying the parameter p, the kawachi process can generate regular (p = 0), ﬁsmall-worldﬂ (0.02 p 0.1), random (0.5 p 1), and ﬁscale-freeﬂ (p 2) networks. figure (ii) shows the values of four network metrics as p is varied: the average distance d between nodes, the clustering coefficient c, the node connectivity k (a measure of robustness), and the symmetry ratio r. the ﬁsmall-worldﬂ and random networks correspond to phase transitions where network metrics change slowly with respect to p. in particular, random networks are characterised by the clustering coefficient c reaching a minimum and the symmetry ratio r reaching a maximum, with the average distance d between nodes low, and the node connectivity k close to the minimum value of one. 01234567891000.020.050.10.20.512kawachi process parameters*10dc*10kr figure (ii). values of average distance (d), clustering coefficient (c), node connectivity (k), symmetry ratio (r), and performance score (s) for different values of the kawachi process parameter in the experiment reported here, and shown in figure (i), a simulated networked friendly force of 30 agents was engaged in combat with a hostile force of 60 non-networked (but otherwise identical) agents. figure (ii) shows the combat performance scores s, defined to be the logarithm of the adjusted loss exchange ratio (averaged over 2000 combats for each network). performance was best for the ﬁscale-freeﬂ (p = 2) case. network performance was best explained as a function of 1/d. this is consistent with past work (dekker 2002a, 2002b, 2003, 2004) in which the intelligence coefficient was the best predictor, since the intelligence coefficient is proportional to 1/d in this case. the dependence on d was confirmed by using a simple star network, with 29 nodes connected to one central hub (d = 1.93). the star network had an average score of 1.002 over 2000 runs, an improvement of 8% on the p = 2 case. unlike past studies (dekker 2004), the node connectivity k had no effect on performance. this is because the networked force in the present experiment possessed tactical agility: the combination of near-perfect sensor information, rapid reliable communications, and the ability to evade and retaliate against threats.

{WS_FSLASH}modsim05{WS_FSLASH}papers{WS_FSLASH}goto.pdf	 conjectural variations; japanese oil industry; deregulation; structural econometricsextended abstract the purpose of this paper is to investigate how firms in the japanese oil industry expect their rivals to react when the firm changes its output level. this paper focuses on an act of deregulation, the abolition of production quotas for two oil products, diesel oil and kerosene, in march 1992. following this deregulation, oil companies could freely supply oil products. a key questions arising from this deregulation is how did the regulated industry behave in the face of this ﬁreleaseﬂ from the prior production constraints. there have been several recent studies of the japanese oil industry, but they have all focused on the impact of the abolition of the tokusekiho, the provisional law relating to the importation of specified petroleum products, that restricted the importation of specified petroleum products to limited number of companies. the tokusekiho, was abolished at the end of march 1996. however, despite this liberalization, total imports of specified petroleum products, gasoline, diesel oil and kerosene, have been very small relative to the total production of these products in japan. this paper casts doubt on the positive evaluation of the abolition of tokusekiho that the media has often suggested. this paper analyzes two oil products, diesel oil and kerosene. all recent studies of the japanese oil industry have analyzed the behavior of firms and the retail price of just gasoline product despite the fact that the liberalization covered three oil products. an evaluation of the differences in the magnitudes of competition for oil products other than gasoline is necessary in order to fully analyze the effect of deregulation. figure 1 depicts the structure of the estimation process in this paper. on the supply side, this paper assumes that the situation in the japanese oil industry was the beginning of quantity setting competition. using the conjectural variation approach (cva), the paper investigates how one firm expects its rival firms in the oil industry to react when the firm changes its output level. on the demand side, a log-linear demand function is estimated. each firm™s first order condition derived from profit maximization contains the price elasticity of demand. therefore, in order to achieve more efficient estimation, joint estimation of the supply and demand sides is conducted by using the general method of moments (gmm) estimator. furthermore, the impact of the abolition of the temporary protection law, tokusekiho, and two mergers of gasoline firms is also investigated.  figure 1. structure of estimation process in stark contrast to the results obtained by goto and mckenzie (2005) for gasoline, the results here show that firms in the japanese oil industry almost never expect their rivals to react when the firm changes its output level. one possible reason for this outcome is that commercial customers such as bus companies and truck carrying companies, form a significant part of the demand of diesel oil. these customers may not switch between suppliers so readily. as a result, firms do not need to worry about their rival™s behavior. a large part of the demand of kerosene is used by households for home heating plant. there has been a national policy to maintain a stable price of kerosene therefore, the market may be non-competitive, and the degree of interaction among firms may be small.

{WS_FSLASH}modsim05{WS_FSLASH}papers{WS_FSLASH}kinsey-henderson.pdf	 hillslope, runoff, overland flow, lisem, burdekin, sediment deliveryextended abstract: in this study we use modelling techniques to consider the effects of hillslope configuration and condition on both the magnitude and spatial variability of runoff from a 1.2 ha hillslope in the semi-arid burdekin catchment of north queensland, australia. we then discuss how these runoff predictions might influence suspended sediment yield. the burdekin catchment at 130,000 km2, is the second largest catchment draining to the great barrier reef world heritage area (gbrwha). ninety percent of the catchment is utilized for grazing and loss of sediment from these grazing lands is a potentially serious issue not just at the source, but in regard to downstream water quality and the effects on the gbrwha. a hydrological model, lisem, was calibrated using results from a field monitoring campaign carried out in the weany creek sub-catchment, a tributary of the burdekin. a number of scenarios were modelled on a 1.2 ha flume site in the weany creek catchment, examining the impact of slope, vegetation cover and vegetation distribution (including patch size) on runoff. the results indicate that runoff is very sensitive to changes in both vegetation cover and distribution, the ‚riparian good™ scenario yielded 136 m3 (35%) more water than current conditions while the ‚riparian poor™ scenario resulted in 384 m3 (98%) more runoff (i.e. almost double current conditions). this is despite both scenarios having the same proportion of good, average, and poor cover as current conditions. when all of the cover was changed to ‚good™, runoff decreased to 0.4 m3, and when it was all ‚poor™, it increased to 1422 m3 œ more than tripling current conditions. in addition to total vegetation cover, the patchiness of the vegetation also seems to have a significant impact on total water yield. when the good, average and poor cover was distributed evenly across the hillslope in 16 by 16 metre random patches, the runoff was 83 m3 (21%) more than current conditions, compared to 30 m3 (8%) less when it was distributed in 4 by 4 metre patches. conversely, changes in slope had very little impact on runoff, with a doubling in slope leading to an increase of only 19 m3 (5%) over current conditions, and a halving of slope leading to a decrease of 24 m3 (6%). similarly, turning a planar slope into a convex one decreased runoff by 9 m3 (2%) while a concave slope decreased it by 50 m3 (13%). predicted discharge from flume (m3)02004006008001000current (392)convex curvature (383)concave curvature (342)double slope (411)halve slope (368)riparian good (528)riparian poor (776)4m random patches (362)16m random patches (475)all poor (1422)all good (0.4)b patch (34% of flume)c patch (57% of flume)d patch (9% of flume) figure 1: modelled runoff from a 1.2 ha flume for a 230mm rainfall event in january, 2005. b, c and d patches represent good, medium, and poor condition respectively. when attempting to predict spatial patterns of runoff, our modelling suggests the need to consider not only the dependence on vegetation patterns (and to a lesser extent slope), but also the often subtle patterns of flow concentration that may develop at the scale of a typical hillslope. preliminary predictions of fine sediment yield, derived by combining predicted hillslope runoff patterns with measures of sediment concentrations at patch scale, suggest the dependence on spatial patterns of vegetation and terrain at the hillslope scale may be even stronger for suspended sediment yield than for runoff..

{WS_FSLASH}modsim05{WS_FSLASH}papers{WS_FSLASH}marsh.pdf	 path planning; agent; unmanned aerial vehicle; simulation; dynamic programming.extended abstract this paper introduces a simulation designed to test real-time path planning done by single and multiple agents. the components of the simulation include a road network, several uninhabited aerial vehicles (uavs) with electro-optic sensors, a target and an uninhabited ground vehicle (ugv). the target and ugv are located on the road network. random blockages are placed on the road network, possibly preventing ugv traversal to the target. these blockages can be detected by the uavs. figure (i) outlines the components in the simulation. figure (i). components of the simulation the task of the uavs is to scan the road network and find the optimal clear path for the ugv. the simulation ends when the optimal path is found or no clear path exists. an online path planning algorithm extended from a* called online a*, is used in the agents which control the uavs. the algorithm is heuristic based and finds the optimal path in a dynamically changing environment. results from single-agent trials in the simulation showed that in each case, the agent found the optimal path through the road network or determined that no clear path existed. online a* was extended to coordinate multiple agents to perform the path planning task collaboratively. initially a centralized architecture for the multi-agent algorithm was developed. the architecture consisted of a single online a* algorithm which was run by a central uav agent. all new information on the network found by the other uav agents would be returned back to the central uav agent. similarly all uav agents would request their next best road to check from the central uav agent. this architecture performed well in the simulation; however it is prone to failure. if the central uav in this architecture fails for any reason, the other uavs cannot continue their task. a more robust distributed architecture was created. in this architecture each of the agents ran its own search algorithm. however, when a uav starts searching a road it broadcasts this road to the other agents in the team, alerting them that it is already being searched. similarly once an agent discovers that a road is clear or blocked, it broadcasts this information to the other agents. results of trials for this architecture showed that in all cases multiple agents performed the path search faster than a single agent. the results indicate in general that adding more uavs to the path planning task reduces the completion time. the second part of the work presented focuses on a stochastic dynamic programming formulation of the path planning problem. here, instead of searching road paths, as does the previous work, we search critical intersections or nodes of the network. the optimal policy was calculated via value iteration, for two uavs collaboratively path planning on a road network containing ten critical nodes. monte carlo simulations were conducted to find the optimal starting locations for each uav. the results showed that if there is a high probability that the network will be blocked, the best strategy to minimize the time of finding a clear optimal path or blocked network, is to start both uavs at the target. this results in a ﬁbreadth-heavyﬂ search. however, if you are optimistic and believe the road network will be clear, the best strategy is to start one uav at the target and one at the ugv, performing a ﬁdepth-heavyﬂ search.

{WS_FSLASH}modsim05{WS_FSLASH}papers{WS_FSLASH}rizzoli.pdf	 integrated modelling frameworks; ontologies; model linking; model reuse. extended abstract it is commonly accepted that modelling frame-works offer a powerful tool for modellers, re-searchers and decision makers, since they allow the management, re-use and integration of models from various disciplines and at different spatial and temporal scales. however, the actual re-usability of models de-pends on a number of factors such as the accessi-bility of the source code, the compatibility of dif-ferent binary platforms, and often it is left to the modellersõ own discipline and responsibility to structure a complex model in such a way that it is decomposed in smaller ôre-usableõ sub-components. what reusable and interchangeable means is also somewhat vague; although several approaches to build modelling frameworks have been developed, little attention has been dedicated to the intrinsic re-usability of components.  in this paper we focus on how models can be linked together to build complex integrated mod-els. we review and investigate the various ap-proaches to model linking adopted by a number of integrated modelling frameworks and we aim at describing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. we stress that even if a model component inter-face is clear and reusable in software terms, this is not a sufficient condition for reusing a component across different integrated modelling frame-works. this remark reveals the need for adding rich semantics in model interfaces; we do such an attempt through the use of domain classes and ontologies. a domain class can be considered as an abstract data structure for defining a set of a model vari-ables and their attributes (rizzoli et al. 1998). a model interface (in terms of inputs, outputs, states and parameters) can be defined using a domain class, providing some advantages: first of all, an instance of a domain class can be accessed at run-time to supply the model component with the ap-propriate data. secondly, it annotates model vari-ables with attributes that can be used for pre-post condition checks. thirdly, it supports compliance with the requirement that asks for model compo-nents to be separated from their data structures. and, last but not least, it provides an easy way for linking model components at a higher level. this practice uses shared domain classes for interchang-ing data across models, taking full advantage of component-based software engineering primitives. then, we present an approach based on the formali-sation of ontologies to describe modelsõ interfaces and relationships. the use of ontologies is advan-tageous as it (a) supports the automatic generation of code templates for models and domain classes in different integrated modelling frameworks, (b) it facilitates the application of a reasoner (inference engine) on the structured knowledge, which can detect abnormalities or conflicts in model inter-faces, and (c) it supports model linking in a content-enriched way, which can be proven valuable for avoiding common problems related to poor seman-tics of model interfaces. finally, this paper presents a working example of an ontology formalisation developed for the seam-less project1. this ontology (called seamag) aims to formally describe biophysical models related to agronomic and environmental domain to be devel-oped by a large community of modellers within the seamless project. modellersõ knowledge, related to model subsystems, variables and interfaces, is kept separated from the actual implementation. the use of the seamag ontology for storing model inter-faces supports the independence of software design choices from modelling knowledge, which be easily reused, integrated in different environments, or shared with third parties. the potentials of extend-ing the presented ontology-driven approach is dis-cussed not only for model linking, but also in the context of building model component workflows using web services.                                1 http://www.seamless-ip.org

{WS_FSLASH}modsim05{WS_FSLASH}papers{WS_FSLASH}savige.pdf	 evapotranspiration; land surface fluxes; remote sensing.extended abstract land surface fluxes have been estimated from remotely sensed data at high pixel resolutions (approximately 60 m) with reasonable accuracy when compared to ground measurements (french et al., 2003; kustas and norman, 1999). the remote sensing input used to model land surface fluxes may consist of land surface temperature and a vegetation index. remotely sensed land surface temperature estimates are strongly affected by atmospheric effects and the generally unknown land surface emissivity. these effects mean that land surface temperature estimates can vary by 1œ3 degrees. similarly, the visible and infra-red bands that are used to calculate vegetation indices are affected by the atmosphere and radiance data should be corrected before calculating such indices. this study investigates the impacts on modelled land surface fluxes of using atmospherically corrected and uncorrected remote sensing input data in two different energy balance models. two energy balance models were selected for testing. the first (sebal) is a one-source model that calculates the sensible heat flux, net radiation and soil heat flux at each remote sensing pixel and estimates the latent heat flux as the residual term in the energy balance. the second (tsm) is a two-source model that uses a vegetation index to partition the land surface temperature between the vegetation and soil at each pixel and then evaluates the energy balance separately over the two land surface components. land surface temperature was estimated from both atmospherically corrected and uncorrected landsat etm+ band 6 data. atmospherically corrected and uncorrected reflectance in the red and near-infrared bands was used to calculate a vegetation index. these remotely sensed data were used as input in the two different models to estimate the energy balance components at the land surface. the resulting latent heat flux (le) across the study region is shown in figure 1. figure 1. latent heat flux (le) in study area from sebal model with landsat 7 etm+ data as remote sensing input, 31 january 2003. while atmospheric corrections are important for obtaining accurate estimates of the normalised difference vegetation index (ndvi), the impact on the modelled flux of a 5œ15% change in ndvi was less than 10 wm-2 for both models. the atmospheric corrections for the land surface temperature caused the greatest impact on the modelled energy balance components. an increase of 2 degrees in land surface temperature at the pasture sites caused the sensible heat flux estimated by the sebal model to be reduced by approximately 10% (or 20 wm-2) while the tsm sensible heat flux increased by as much as 50œ175 wm-2 at the pasture sites. these results indicate the importance of making appropriate atmospheric corrections to thermal remotely sensed data for land surface flux estimation.

{WS_FSLASH}modsim05{WS_FSLASH}papers{WS_FSLASH}tan_z.pdf	 bushfire attack; bushfire behaviour; radiation; view factor. extended abstract bushfires are natural hazards posing severe threat to property, life and the environment. to minimize bushfire risks, many bushfire protection measures can be taken. among these measures are land use planning, development controls and hazard reduction. the proper implementation of these measures requires that the level of bushfire attack be estimated with an appropriate approach. although two qualitative approaches for this purpose are currently available in australia, that is, the approaches specified in as 3959 1999 (sa, 1999) and nsw planning for bushfire protection 2001 (pfbfp) (nsw rfs, 2001), they have some intrinsic shortcomings such as low assessment accuracy and limited application range.  in order to overcome the shortcomings with the existing approaches, a new quantitative assessment methodology together with a computer program implementing the methodology has been developed by the authors. the methodology consists of two sets of equations. the first set of equations are used for modelling flame length while the second set of equations are used for modelling radiation. depending on the types of vegetation, flame length is modelled by different empirical flame length equations. radiation modelling is based on a generalised view factor model which takes effects of inclined flame and the attenuation into account.  the new methodology involves a large amount of computational effort. although it is possible for a professional to conduct a manual assessment, the task would become very time consuming and error-prone. to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the methodology as well as its availability, it has been coded in visual basic for application (vba) within the ms access database environment. as shown in figure 1, the computerisation process consists of five major steps, that is, specifying inputs, calculating flame   length, calculating radiation, determining bushfire attack level and displaying outputs.  calculate flame length calculate radiant heat                                                                                                                            outputoutput     begin calculate rate of spread calculate fire intensity calculate flame length calculate view factor calculate radiation determine category of attack and construction level end input calculate transmissivity figure 1. the flowchart of the implementation  compared with the existing approaches for bushfire assessment, the computerised model has following features: 1. it allows bushfire attack assessment to be conducted in a more efficient and accurate way.  2. it is more flexible and has a wider application range. 3. it reflects the latest research findings and is more scientifically advanced.
