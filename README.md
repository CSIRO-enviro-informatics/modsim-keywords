# modsim-keywords
The repository contains scripts to collect, process and store keywords from papers presented at past MODSIM conferences hosted by the [Modelling & Simulation Society of Australian & New Zealand (MSSANZ)](https://mssanz.org.au).

We are attempting to collect keywords used in MODSIM ['09](https://mssanz.org.au/modsim09/), ['11](https://mssanz.org.au/modsim2011/), ['13](https://mssanz.org.au/modsim2013/), ['15](https://mssanz.org.au/modsim2015/) and ['17](https://mssanz.org.au/modsim2017/) and, after cleaning them by fixing spelling, deduplicating and so on, presenting them as a simple [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) vocabulary so that they may be used by a keyword suggestions UI to be implemented in the paper repository system to be used in [MODSIM 2019](https://mssanz.org.au/modsim2019/).
